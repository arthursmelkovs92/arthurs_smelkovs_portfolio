    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>One of my primary interests is my passion for technology and coding. Even before embarking on my career journey in IT, I found immense joy in coding as a hobby. Whether it was creating a basic game or developing visual projects, I loved engaging in activities that combined creativity and technical skill. This early fascination with coding not only fueled my enthusiasm for technology but also laid the foundation for my professional path in the IT field.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I have a lot of hobbies, and sometimes itâ€™s hard to keep up with all of them due to the nature of my current role in IT. However, I maintain a balance between physical and mental activities. During my workdays, I primarily focus on going to the gym to keep myself physically and mentally fit, preparing me to tackle the next day's challenges. Staying active and regularly attending work helps me stay focused and ready for any challenges that come my way.If there's enough time after the gym, I like to do some coding and update my existing GitHub projects. On weekends, I love to dive back into coding as it is both stimulating and relaxing for me. Whenever the opportunity arises, I enjoy attending IT conferences, whether in different cities or locally. Regularly attending these conferences helps me learn more about developing technologies and connect with like-minded people, allowing me to share my experiences and learn from others.</p>
